A Python Conference in Switzerland
==================================

The Swiss Python Summit 2016 was a blast! We had magnificent talks and met lots of brilliant people. That's why we decided
to have a second edition of the conference to take place on **February 17th, 2017** at
**HSR University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil**.

This summit is all about the programming language you love!
Discover the wide field of Python applications, hear how others use the snake
and meet Swiss Pythonistas. The conference is suited for all skill levels,
from early beginners to expert developers.

History
=======

After the nice experience of EuroPython 2015, a small group of enthusiasts came
up with the idea of organizing a Swiss Python Conference.

As with software development, we think it's a good idea to start with something
simple to prove that it can be done, a minimal viable product. We try to keep
the costs and the organizational effort very low:

* It will be a one day event
* Lunch will be paid by attendees themselves
* At this time, we cannot offer speakers or helpers any compensation

How to Collaborate
==================
